# Race Detection for Future-Parallel Compuations

A project to automatically detect determinacy races on-the-fly in
programs that use futures. Users should use the futures provided by
this project, not the class of future objects provided with C++11.

Currently, this system only detects futures while running
sequentially. We have plans to parallelize our race detection
algorithm.
